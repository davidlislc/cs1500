This buffalo

looks out across a barren land;

once remembered, here,

in a time erased by man

And then Mother Nature

lifts her fists and brows

to remind us of our

brief mortality

Once remembered here, you and meâ€¦

Drawn in now by birds and squirrels

untrimmed grass

bluest skies

Spring quiet

cool breeze

in a time erased of man.
