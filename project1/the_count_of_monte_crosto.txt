BY ALEXANDRE DUMAS
As much the work of Auguste Maquet—the ghostwriter who was responsible for much of the actual text of the novel—as Dumas himself, The Count of Monte Cristo has become the archetypal revenge story for all works that have followed. Set in 19th-century France, from the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe, this adventure story follows the single-minded Edmund Dantès, falsely imprisoned after being set up by friends who envied his fortune. Dantès is likely based on the real story of Pierre Picaud, a shoemaker falsely accused of treason who, once released from prison, embarked on a course of vengence that spun wildly out of hand. Like his real counterpart, the fictional Dantès works to exact revenge on all those who have wronged him. The novel evokes key questions about the nature of justice—and whether humans are meant to seek their own vengeance when wronged.
